# Final Project

## Question(s)

* How do I create a personal network attached storage (NAS)?
* What hardware is necessary for this NAS?
* What software is needed?

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to have a storage media that I can easily access on the local network in my home. It would consist of a device that can connect to the network as well as easily handling large loads, such
as large file transfers and full system backups. The device will not need an Ethernet port, but it would be preferred as well as WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.

## Premonitions

* A Raspberry Pi is not likely not sufficient, given its mobile processer and lack of high speed transfer ports.
* Software, even flavors of the Linux OS, are exclusively designed for NAS.
* Since the device would not have to be available 24/7, a larger, more powerful	device would not be inefficient.
